# nlddoc

A simple way to turn markdown files into an interactive documentation site.


## What is it?

nlddoc takes a folder of markdown files and generates a documentation website. Your folder structure becomes the navigation menu, and you get live preview while editing.

- Search across all your docs
- Responsive layout that works on mobile
- Hot reload as you edit
- Zero configuration needed

Built on VitePress for fast, reliable static site generation.

## Quick Start

### View your docs

```bash
npx nlddoc serve .
```

Opens a local server with your documentation. Edit any file and see changes instantly.

### Build for deployment

```bash
npx nlddoc build . ./website
```

Creates a static site you can host anywhere.
